Usage \u00b6 Follow these steps to create a new repository that uses this repository as a template. Adapted from GitHub\u2019s documentation . On GitHub, navigate to the main page of this template repository: https://github.com/cal-itp/mkdocs-template Above the file list, click Use this template Configure the new repository\u2019s details, including the Owner ( cal-itp ), Name , and Description Ensure the new repository\u2019s visiblity is set to Public Ensure the checkbox to Include all branches is checked Click Create repository from template to finish and create the new repository IMPORTANT: review the LICENSE file and ensure it is appropriate for your new project.

How does this work? \u00b6 mkdocs \u00b6 mkdocs turns markdown content inside the docs/ directory into HTML+CSS+JS needed for a website. The mkdocs.yml file in the root of the repository configures website settings and available plugins for this build process. The docs/requirements.txt file lists the python dependencies necessary to build the documentation using mkdocs . GitHub Actions \u00b6 A GitHub Action called mhausenblas/mkdocs-deploy-gh-pages enables automated building of new documentation content using mkdocs , whenever the content changes. Our workflow is defined in the .github/workflows/mkdocs.yml file. The action uses the docs/requirements.txt file to install the necessary dependencies for building the docs site. After running mkdocs , the action redeploys the documentation site by force-pushing to the gh-pages branch.
